## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin to remove all links
that use other protocols than the ones specified
(`http` and `https` by default).

## When should I use this?

This project is useful if you want to limit the protocols
that can be linked to when processing markdown.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-unlink-protocols
```

## Use

Say we have the following file `example.md` and apply `remark-unlink-protocols`
with the default protocols (`http` and `https`).

```markdown
# Uranus

**Uranus** is the seventh [planet](/wiki/Planet 'Planet') from the Sun and is a
gaseous cyan [ice giant](/wiki/Ice_giant 'Ice giant').

Photograph of Uranus in true colour by Voyager 2 in 1986:

![This is an image of the planet Uranus taken by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986.
The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#/media/File:Uranus_as_seen_by_NASA's_Voyager_2_(remastered)_-_JPEG_converted.jpg>)

Send comments to [me](mailto:test@domain.example)
```

…and a module `example.js`:

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkUnlinkProtocols from 'remark-unlink-protocols'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'

const file = await remark()
  .use(remarkUnlinkProtocols({ except: 'mailto' })
  .process(await read('example.md'))

console.log(String(file))
```

…then running `node example.js` yields:

```markdown
